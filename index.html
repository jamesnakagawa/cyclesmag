I think it’s because it was an easy way to fend off feelings of disappointment. I want to feel closer to you. I do. But everytime I do I take on this hyperfocus - this insufferable coping/defense mechanism that blocks me from feeling anything at all. But I want to feel something so badly. Then again, who is that for? Me? For me to prove to myself that I can love? Be loved? Give love? What if I don’t want you at all? What if you’re the closest thing to something real and I’m using you like an experimental trial of my own ability to feel something? And then, what if I’m not emotionally available after all. What if I’m still moving in cycles. Except I have taken on the role of the aggressor. I’ve become the one that hurts, rather than the one hurting. Then what?</div></div><div class="ghost prose"><div class="inner text">I'm terrified of time. It's planting grey hairs on my parents, it's weakening my metabolism, it's overwhelming me with fomo for life. My biggest fear of all is letting life pass me by. The present is the only thing that exists, but the past and future echo and scream, stealing the present away. I'm stuck in a paradox of wanting to remember, wanting to plan, and wanting to live in the now. I don't have an answer, but time doesn't care - it waits for no one. And that terrifies me.</div></div><div class="ghost prose"><div class="inner text">We dont have to follow the accelerated nature of time and the world that we currently do. Thats what the pandemic showed me bro; Days drew on and things that felt like they were urgent turned out not be you know. Movie releases, assignment due dates, taxes, renewing documents. And we could appreciate what really mattered, Now there was this extra leeways that no one had seen coming that gave us more time to stop and think, do we actually need prisons ? What happens if we abolish the police ? How is homelessness still a thing in a world with billionaires?Why am I here writing code for 6hours straight everyday ?, how didn’t I know drugs were so good ?, stuff like that. We were in the verge of creating new unimagined futures with better,,, never mind I have to get back to work now.</div></div><div class="ghost"><div class="inner text">I find myself reaching for the same crutches. Coping mechanisms that are more comfortable than they are effective. But again, I never seem to exit the pattern. Instead, I dissolve further. Deeper.</div></div><div class="ghost prose"><div class="inner text">Love wasn't something I grew up expressing, processing, experiencing. For us, love was achievement, pride, over-protectiveness.
