            It isn't so much the presence of fear, as it is about its absence. You notice it - the peacefulness of a head void of anxieties. You start to wonder when it will be back, what you will do then.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            I was pleasantly surprised by my lack of fear. It was like I could finally be myself, in all of myself, for us both to enjoy. But there were moments where our pasts caught up with us faster than we could catch our breaths from running away from everything else.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            In those moments, I had never been so scared. Of losing you, losing myself in you, losing my sense of self in yours which seemed to always be fluctuating between cautious and critical to a fault. I never understood what you meant when you said you feared that you were unpredictable. I didn't fully understand what it meant for someone to be volatile. I too, was afraid of what it meant to be driven by fear. But, this wasn't about trust issues. Your emotions struck such fear because you couldn't control them. They controlled you.

            <p>As we return again, to cycles, I feel myself weighing lonelier; I recognize less the things I want, those I need. What I think will make me happy is obscured by the chaotic nature of being stuck in the same patterns over and over again. What doesn't work continue to not work. I continue to lack agency, feel inadequate. I wonder when it will be my turn. When I will be free.</p>

            <p>I find myself reaching for the same crutches. Coping mechanisms that are more comfortable than they are effective. But again, I never seem to exit the pattern. Instead, I dissolve further. Deeper.</p>
