            It isn't so much the presence of fear, as it is about its absence. You notice it - the peacefulness of a head void of anxieties. You start to wonder when it will be back, what you will do then.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            I was pleasantly surprised by my lack of fear. It was like I could finally be myself, in all of myself, for us both to enjoy. But there were moments where our pasts caught up with us faster than we could catch our breaths from running away from everything else.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            In those moments, I had never been so scared. Of losing you, losing myself in you, losing my sense of self in yours which seemed to always be fluctuating between cautious and critical to a fault. I never understood what you meant when you said you feared that you were unpredictable. I didn't fully understand what it meant for someone to be volatile. I too, was afraid of what it meant to be driven by fear. But, this wasn't about trust issues. Your emotions struck such fear because you couldn't control them. They controlled you.

I live through pain and healing, and despite the challenges my cup runneth over. If it happened once it can happen again. If it hasn’t happened yet, doesn’t mean it won’t. Trust and faith are important.</div></div>

            <div class="ghost prose"><div class="inner">I was doomscrolling a lot yesterday. I think it’s because it was an easy way to fend off feelings of disappointment. I want to feel closer to you. I do. But everytime I do I take on this hyperfocus - this insufferable coping/defense mechanism that blocks me from feeling anything at all. But I want to feel something so badly. Then again, who is that for? Me? For me to prove to myself that I can love? Be loved? Give love? What if I don’t want you at all? What if you’re the closest thing to something real and I’m using you like an experimental trial of my own ability to feel something? 
                And then, what if I’m not emotionally available after all. What if I’m still moving in cycles. Except I have taken on the role of the aggressor. I’ve become the one that hurts, rather than the one hurting. Then what?</div></div>
            <div class="ghost prose"><div class="inner">I'm terrified of time. It's planting grey hairs on my parents, it's weakening my metabolism, it's overwhelming me with fomo for life. My biggest fear of all is letting life pass me by. The present is the only thing that exists, but the past and future echo and scream, stealing the present away. I'm stuck in a paradox of wanting to remember, wanting to plan, and wanting to live in the now. I don't have an answer, but time doesn't care - it waits for no one. And that terrifies me.</div></div>
